PamPan is a helpful pantry keeper aimed at combatting food-waste. It tries to be as seamless in adding items to the app as possible. PamPan was originally written as part of the IEEE Students day competition in 2024.

### Features
- CRUD operations on food items for an appwrite and a scrapped sqlite database.
- Automatic filling of item details using barcodes or Gemini vision AI.
- Automatic reminder notifications when items are near-expiry.
- Chatbot integration (WIP. Recommends recipies using near-expiry items).
- Calendar view of pantry's expiry dates.
- (Incomplete) Map view of nearest food shelters.
